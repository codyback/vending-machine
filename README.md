# Vending Machine CLI

A command-line interface that displays an inventory from a file and allows the user to add money and buy items from the user interface using that money.

# Project Description

You've been asked to develop an application for the newest vending machine distributor, Umbrella Corp. They've released a new vending machine, Vendo-Matic 800, that is integrated with everyone's bank accounts, allowing customers to purchase products from their computers for their convenience.

This collaborative project was apart of the Tech Elevator curriculum using Java / File I/O / Unit Testing / and was used as capstone to showcase Object-Orientated Principles. We learned about different design patterns as we came across different problems, and how to use Git to collaborate with others and solve merge conflicts.
